# HW-17-WorkoutTracker

## With this application, the user is able to view, create, and track daily workouts. They can also log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. The user can track the name, type, weight, number of sets, reps, and duration of exercises. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, it will be able to track the distance traveled.
